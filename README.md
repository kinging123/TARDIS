# TARDIS
TARDIS is a simple WordPress theme built with AngularJS and the RESTful API.

**Please note that this theme is *not* built with best practices. It is only a quick demo that I put up at the Israel WordCamp 2016 for time saving purpuses.**
If you'd like to learn more about best practices, I recommend [1fix.io's guide](https://1fix.io/angularjs-wp-rest-api/).
